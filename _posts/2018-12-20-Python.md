# CS50-L1-Python-Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

**prepare**

1. Install **Atom** - A hackable text editor for the 21st Century.
2. Install **Python** to your own computer.

**some python commands**

1. The string which is the text enclosed in double quotation marks -- begin with the letter **F**. This is a new feature of Python version 3.6 -- called the format strings, which let us take a string, take text and substitute information by filling in blanks in the string wherever we want to put a placeholder for some other value.

```python
name = input()              //string
print(f"hello, {name}!")
```



2. Four different types of Python variables

   ```python
   i = 28                   //integer
   print(f"i is {i}")
   
   f = 2.8                  //floating point values
   print(f"f is {f}")
   
   b = True                 //bool which stands for Boolean values
   print(f"b is {b}")
   
   n = None 
   print(f"n is {n}")        //None type, which only has one possible 	                             value, just calles a None.
   ```

   A None type which is a way in Python to represent the idea that a variables no value. So if we want a variable that doesn't have value for some reason, this will be helpful.

3. conditions

   ```python
   x = 28
   if x > 0:
       print("x is positive")
   elif x < 0:
       print("x is negative")
   else:
       print("x is zero")
   ```


4. Storing **sequences of data** where we have multiple values that are combines together under one name.

   ```python
   name = "Alice"
   coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
   names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
   data = [28, "Alice", True]
   print(names[0], data[0])
   
   ```

   The result will be **Alice 28** 

5. Loops

   ```python
   for i in range(5):
       print(i)
   ```

   The results will be **0,1,2,3,4**

6. Set -- a collection of items where no item shows up twice.

   ```python
   s = set()
   s.add(1)
   s.add(3)
   s.add(3)
   s.add(5)
   s.add(3)
   print(s)
   ```

   The results will be **{1, 3, 5}**

7. Dictionaries -- a data structure in Python which are used in order to **map certain values on to other values**. And they're often used when we want to try and indicate  some sort of relationship between a former value and a latter value.

   ```python
   ages = {"Alice": 22, "Bob": 27}
   ages["Charlie"] = 30
   ages["Alice"] += 1
   print(ages)
   ```

   The results will be **{'Alice': 23, 'Bob': 27, 'Charlie': 30}** 

8. Functions

   ```python
   def square(x):
       return x * x
   
   
   for i in range(10):
       print("{} squared is {}".format(i, square(i)))
   
   ```

   The results will be

   **0 squared is 0
   1 squared is 1
   2 squared is 4
   3 squared is 9
   4 squared is 16
   5 squared is 25
   6 squared is 36
   7 squared is 49
   8 squared is 64
   9 squared is 81**

9. Classes -- a way of defining entirely new types in Python.

   So Python has a built in type for representing lists.

   ```python
   class Point:
       def __init__(self, x, y):
           self.x = x
           self.y = y
   
   
   p = Point(3, 5)
   print(p.x)
   print(p.y)
   ```

   When I create a new Point, what should I do? Self dot x equals x is my way of saying self is that name, referring to the Point object that I've just created. And dot x is my way of saying, I want to access a particular attribute of the self, of the Point that I've created. That way, when I create a new point, I'm storing that x value inside of self.x

   The results will be 

   **3**

   **5**
