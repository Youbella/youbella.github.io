#How to Be Positive?

> wikiHow: How to be Positive

Many of our experiences in life are a result of how we interpret and respond to our surroundings. Choosing positive emotions and ways of thinking can bring us a better life. But how?



1. **Accept where you are.**
   You can't change the way you think if you won't identify the problem. Accepting that you have negative thoughts and feelings, and that you don’t enjoy how you’re currently responding to them, can help you begin the process of change.
2. **Make goals.**
   Goals give us a more positive outlook on life. Research has shown that setting a goal can make you feel immediately more confident and hopeful, even if you don’t achieve the goal right away. Setting goals that are personally meaningful to you and align with your values will help you achieve them and move forward in your life.
3. **Get some exercise.**
   Exercise can help fight feelings of anxiety and depression. Studies have also shown that regular, moderate exercise increases your feelings of calmness and well-being. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day.

Recently, I feel very depressed because I failed three times in the job interview. I can't stop thinking about that my parents have invested all their money and love to me but I can't even find a job now. I am unwilling to let my parents down or admit I'm a loser. So I need to adjust my mindset and prepare for the next interview. If you have same trouble with me, I hope this blog would help you a little. **Fight!**
